# SkapNightly: a fun fork of [SkapClient](https://nky5223.github.io/SkapClient)
SkapNightly is a fork of SkapClient made for looks, and customizability. [SkapClient](https://nky5223.github.io/SkapClient) is an unofficial client for the game [skap.io](https://skap.io).

## No, you're not getting your own special hat, chat color, skin, etc.
Accounts which have special cosmetics in game are staying the same as [SkapClient](https://nky5223.github.io/SkapClient). No one else is getting anything special, not even myself.
